  <!-- Whether the generated archive will contain these two Maven files: -->
<!-- The pom file, located in the archive in META-INF/maven/${groupId}/${artifactId}/pom.xml -->
<!-- A pom.properties file, located in the archive in META-INF/maven/${groupId}/${artifactId}/pom.properties -->

<!-- Whether recreating the archive is forced (default) or not. Setting this option to false, means that the archiver should compare the timestamps of included files with the timestamp of the target archive and rebuild the archive, only if the latter timestamp precedes the former timestamps. Checking for timestamps will typically offer a performance gain (in particular, if the following steps in a build can be suppressed, if an archive isn't recrated) on the cost that you get inaccurate results from time to time. In particular, removal of source files won't be detected. -->
<!-- An archiver doesn't necessarily support checks for uptodate. If so, setting this option to true will simply be ignored. -->
